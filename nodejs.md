# Node.js

## [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/(, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. [More about Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/).

## [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the package manager for javascript. 

## [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) : Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js 
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

## udemy course : [Learn and Understand NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/learn/#/)
Dive deep under the hood of NodeJS. Learn V8, Express, the MEAN stack, core Javascript concepts, and more. 
In this course you will gain a deep understanding of Node, learn how NodeJS works under the hood. During it all you'll gain a deep understanding of the Javascript concepts and other computer science concepts that power Node.

- How the C++ written V8 Javascript engine works and how NodeJS uses it to expand the abilities of Javascript. You'll learn how to structure your code for reuse and to be easier to understand, manage, and expand using modules and understand how modules really work.
- How asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop, as well as how to use the event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files. We'll see how that leads to building a web server in Node. 
- We'll dive into web sites, web apps and APIs with Express and learn how Express can save us time as Node developers.
- You'll also gain an understanding of npm, connecting to databases, and the MEAN stack!
