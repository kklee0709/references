# Angular.js

## [Angular.js](https://www.angularjs.org/) backed by Google, HTML enhanced for web apps! 
Why AngularJS? HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

What framework should I learn? ... in order to be relevant in the long term, you should learn programming, not tools. You should learn the underlying fundamentals of tools, so that you know what tools to use, or how to build them yourself when you cannot find one that fits. If you practice *programming* well, not just individual tools or languages, youâ€™ll be a very sought after programmer.
