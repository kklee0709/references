## MDN|[Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) ([한국어: Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/JavaScript)) 
JavaScript® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, most known as the scripting language for Web pages, but used in many non-browser environments as well such as [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) or Apache CouchDB. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

## MDN|[Intermediate JavaScript: A re-introduction to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) : An overview for those who think they know about JavaScript.
Why a re-introduction? Because JavaScript is notorious for being [the world's most misunderstood programming language](http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html). While it is often derided as a toy, beneath its deceptive simplicity lie some powerful language features. JavaScript is now used by an incredible number of high-profile applications, showing that deeper knowledge of this technology is an important skill for any web or mobile developer.

## MDN|[Intermediate JavaScript: Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) : Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables. In other words, the function defined in the closure 'remembers' the environment in which it was created.

## MDN|[Advanced JavaScript: Inheritance and the prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) : Explanation of the widely misunderstood and under-estimated prototype-based inheritance.
The prototypal inheritance model is in fact more powerful than the classic model. It is, for example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a prototypal model, while the other way around is a far more difficult task.

## MDN|[Advanced JavaScript: Strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) : A restricted variant of JavaScript.
